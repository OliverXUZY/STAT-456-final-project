# STAT-456-Final-Project

This is the final project of my course STAT456. This course is about multivatiate analysis, although I have learned when I was a junior students in WHU, I still learned something from this course, and consolidate my previous knowledge(like STAT 601). I use the data from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Horse+Colic to analyze, I use R to load the data and python to proprecessing it (just for fun), then I use R to continue my whole analysis stuff.
